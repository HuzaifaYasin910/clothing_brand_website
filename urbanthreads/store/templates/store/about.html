    <p style="width: 100%;"><br>UrbanThreads is not just a retail space but instead an extension of the brand’s image and philosophy of creating for the youth of today and tomorrow. Thus, when looking at all the elements within our stores; the layout, furniture, lighting, visuals and music, everything is thoughtfully put together to ensure that they resonate with our customer.<br>For Outfitters, there are 4 key words that stay true to our creative philosophy: accessibility, global connectivity, functionality and innovation and these are the ideologies that we carry with us in every store design.<br>Our stores first and foremost will always focus on being accessible to the customer, wether that is through easy movement within the store or through choice availability for the customer.<br>Our strategies within the store are always aligned with global practices and continue to stay functional from both the brand perspective, as well as for the customer’s ease.<br>And lastly, we strive to always be innovative with our store environment, ensuring that we constantly evolve in line with what our customer needs and what Outfitters represents as a brand.<br>The stores, just like our collections, intend to instill a sense of positivity, spirit and of being part of a larger community.<br><br></p>
